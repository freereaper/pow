# PoWERC20 Mining Tool 🚀

## Overview 📖

This Rust project is a fully-functional tool for participating in Ethereum's PoWERC20 mining process. It offers a Rust-based implementation for connecting to the Ethereum blockchain, generating nonces, and submitting transactions upon discovering a valid nonce. Ideal for those interested in Ethereum mining or exploring the mechanics of blockchain interactions in Rust.

## Features ✨

- **Mining Functionality**: Generates nonces and compares the resulting hash with a target, mirroring Ethereum's actual mining process.
- **Parallel Mining Workers**: Leverages Rust's concurrency model with async/await and thread pools for deploying multiple mining workers, boosting the probability of finding a valid nonce.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interfaces with a specified Ethereum smart contract to retrieve the current mining challenge and difficulty.
- **Nonce Submission and Transaction Handling**: Submits the mining solution to the Ethereum network and manages the transaction process after identifying a valid nonce.

## Installation and Setup 🛠️

1. **Install Rust**: Ensure you have Rust 1.60 or newer installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Download this repository to your machine.
3. **Dependency Installation**: Run `cargo build` to fetch and compile the necessary dependencies.
4. **Build the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `cargo build --release` to build the release version of the executable.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Configuration**:

   - Configure your Ethereum private key and contract address in a configuration file or environment variables.
   - Adjust the number of mining workers as desired.

2. **Running the Tool**:
   - Start the tool by running `./target/release/pow-erc20` in your terminal.
   - Optional flags or environment variables can be used for specific configurations.
